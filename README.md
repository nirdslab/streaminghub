# StreamingHub

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xSieE3V.png" height="100px"><br>
StreamingHub is a framework for developing real-time bio-signal analysis workflows.<br>
<img src="assets/demo-animated.gif" width="100%">

It provides the following components:

## DFDS | `dfds/`

JSON schemas to describe data streams, data sets, and analytics, along with a few samples.`<br>`
**Technologies:** JSON, JSON Schema

## PyDFDS | `pydfds/`

A Python package to read DFDS-annotated datasets and their metadata.`<br>`
**Technologies:** Python, Pydantic, JSONSchema, Pydantic

## Curator | `curator/`

A Web interface to annotate files with DFDS metadata and rearranging them in a standard form.`<br>`
**Technologies:** Python, Flask, PyDFDS

## DataMux | `datamux/`

A Python package providing a high-level API to read bio-signal streams.
It supports three modes:
(a) relaying real-time sensory data,
(b) replaying recordings from datasets, and
(c) simulating mock data as test cases.`<br>`
**Technologies:** Python, PyLSL, WebSockets

## FlowMaker | `flowmaker/`

Node-RED addons for using DataMux APIs and visualizing bio-signal data within Node-RED.`<br>`
**Technologies:** Javascript, JSON, Vega

## Repository | `repository/`

A collection of DFDS metadata for commonly used bio-signal datasets and eye-trackers.`<br/>`
**Technologies:** JSON, DFDS

## Examples | `examples/`

A set of real-time bio-signal analysis experiments built upon StreamingHub.`<br/>`
**Technologies:** Python, DataMux, OpenGL

## Archived | `archived/`

An archive of abandoned projects.`<br/>`
**Technologies:** Python, Flask, Angular
