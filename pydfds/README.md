PyDFDS is a parser for Data Flow Description Schema (DFDS) metadata, written using Python.

## Installation

```bash

pip install streaminghub-pydfds==0.1.30

```

## Usage

```python

from dfds import Parser
from dfds.typing import Collection, Stream
from util import restream_data

# define a DFDS parser
parser = Parser()

# open a DFDS collection
fp = "/path/to/collection.json"
collection = parser.get_collection_metadata(fp)
dataloader = collection.dataloader()

# list all items in the collection
for attrs in dataloader.ls():
  for stream_id, stream in collection.streams.items():
      pass

# read an entire recording at once
attrs, data = dataloader.read(stream.attrs)

# or replay the recording as a stream
asyncio.create_task(replay_data(collection, stream))

return streams

```
