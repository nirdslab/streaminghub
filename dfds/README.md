# DFDS - Data Flow Description Schema

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xSieE3V.png" height="100px">

**DFDS** provides schemas to describe the key elements in a data flow.
It lets you describe data collections, data sources, data streams, and data transformations.

StreamingHub uses DFDS metadata to mimic real-time data by _replaying_ data collections.
Creating data streams in this manner gives easy-to-access test data for experiment development and testing.
Several components of streaminghub are also built upon DFDS abstractions.
